# Clean Architecture Idea

## Clean code using solid principles with Nodejs and Typescript

The idea of this project is to offer a clean and concise architecture boilerplate for those trying to navigate on node development.

It respects the fundamentals of clean code and some of the SOLID concepts. This boilerplate has my own flavour, which means that I don't follow follow strictly all the concepts, I rather customize to my own needs. I tried to extract the best practices of the 5 main principles:

- **_S_**: Single responsibility
- **_O_**: Open-Close
- **_L_**: Liskov substitution
- **_I_**: Interface segregation
- **_D_**: Dependency inversion
